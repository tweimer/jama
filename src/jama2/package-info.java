 * <p>
 * JAMA is comprised of six Java classes: Matrix,
 * CholeskyDecomposition, LUDecomposition, QRDecomposition,
 * SingularValueDecomposition and EigenvalueDecomposition.
 * The Matrix class provides the fundamental operations of
 * numerical linear algebra. Various constructors create
 * Matrices from two dimensional arrays of double precision
 * floating point numbers. Various gets and sets provide
 * access to submatrices and matrix elements.
